Sue I've been meaning to write for ages and finally today I'm actually doing something about it. Not that I'm trying to make excuses for myself, it's been really hard to sit down and write, as I've been moving around so much. Since we last saw each other I've unpacked my bags in four different cities. This job has turned out to be more of a whirlwind than I expected, but it's all good! I went from London to Prague to set up a new regional office there. You know I'd always wanted to go, but maybe I was imagining Prague in spring when I used to talk about that. Winter was really hard, with minus 15 degrees in the mornings and dark really early in the evening. But at least it was blue skies and white snow and not days on end of grey skies and rain, like at home. It's tough being away from home over Christmas, though, and Skype on Christmas Day wasn't really the same as being with everyone. So then I was posted to LA, which felt like a whole other country compared with the East Coast. I could definitely get used to that kind of outdoor, beach lifestyle, but I didn't spend as much time getting to know California as I could have because I kind of met someone (!) More about Michael later. Those three months flew by and then I was off again, to Frankfurt, which is where I am now. And … so is Michael! He got a month off work and we're trying to work out how we can be in the same place at the same time for a while. We figure the first step in that direction is getting married, which is also why I wanted to write – I can't get married without my oldest friend there! The wedding's going to be at home in London in September and I hope you can come! Anyway, tell me all your news and I promise not to leave it so long this time! Lots of love, Kathy ")],-1),M={class:"flex flex-col pt-6 justify-center items-center"},P={class:"w-full max-w-3xl"},Q={class:"flex flex-col justify-center pb-24 pt-6 pl-24 pr-24"},D={__name:"Reading",props:["read","selected"],setup(s){const r=s,t=n(1);let c=n(0),u=n("Next Question"),h=n(33);function w(){if(t.value<=4){c=100/4*t.value;let m=r.read;r.selected===m[t.value][5]?(form.answer_id=t.value,form.answer="correct"):(form.answer_id=t.value,form.answer="wrong"),t.value++}t.value===5&&(u="Finish",h=66)}return(m,a)=>(y(),b(p,null,[I,k,e("div",x,[e("div",_,[A,e("div",S,[e("div",C,[e("div",{class:"bg-green-500 h-3.5 rounded-full",style:f({width:d(h)+"%"})},null,4)])])]),e("div",j,[e("h1",B," Questions "+g(t.value)+" of 5 ",1),e("div",F,[e("div",L,[e("div",N,[e("div",{class:"bg-green-500 h-3.5 rounded-full",style:f({width:d(c)+"%"})},null,4)])])])])]),q,e("div",M,[e("div",P,[l(v,{question:t.value,pergunta:s.read[t.value][0]},null,8,["question","pergunta"]),l(i,{name:"A",id:"A",value:s.read[t.value][1],selected:s.selected,"onUpdate:selected":a[0]||(a[0]=o=>s.selected=o)},null,8,["value","selected"]),l(i,{name:"A",id:"A",value:s.read[t.value][2],selected:s.selected,"onUpdate:selected":a[1]||(a[1]=o=>s.selected=o)},null,8,["value","selected"]),l(i,{name:"A",id:"A",value:s.read[t.value][3],selected:s.selected,"onUpdate:selected":a[2]||(a[2]=o=>s.selected=o)},null,8,["value","selected"]),e("div",Q,[e("button",{onClick:w,class:"bg-blue-500 p-3 font-medium rounded-lg text-center"},g(d(u)),1)])])])],64))}};export{D as default};
